# Seccomp Tools
Provides powerful tools for seccomp analysis.

This project is targeted to (but not limited to) analyze seccomp sandbox in CTF pwn challenges.
Some features might be CTF-specific, but still useful for analysis of seccomp in real-case.

## Features
* Dump - Automatically dump seccomp-bpf from binary.
* Disasm - Convert bpf to human readable format.
  - Simple decompile.
  - Show syscall names.
  - (TODO) Simplify disassemble result.
* (TODO) Solve constraints for executing syscalls (e.g. `execve/open/read/write`).
* Support multi-architectures.

## Installation

Will be available on RubyGems.org!
(TODO)

## Command Line Interface

### seccomp-tools

```bash
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(seccomp-tools --help)
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(seccomp-tools --help dump)
```

### dump

Dump the seccomp bpf from an execution file.
This work is done by the `ptrace` syscall.

NOTICE: beware of the execution file will be executed.
```bash
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(file spec/binary/twctf-2016-diary)
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(seccomp-tools dump spec/binary/twctf-2016-diary)
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(seccomp-tools dump spec/binary/twctf-2016-diary -f inspect)
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(seccomp-tools dump spec/binary/twctf-2016-diary -f raw | xxd)
```

### disasm

Disassemble the seccomp bpf.
```bash
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(xxd spec/data/twctf-2016-diary.bpf | head -n 3)
SHELL_OUTPUT_OF(seccomp-tools disasm spec/data/twctf-2016-diary.bpf)
```
